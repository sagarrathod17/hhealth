		An advanced ovulation calculator estimates when you may be ovulating to find your most fertile days. This ovulation calendar calculator uses the calendar method to find the exact ovulation date that helps you to conceive 3x faster. Simply, give a try to a fertility calculator to estimates your fertile window or predicts when are you most fertile.<hr/>

		Note: This calculator only estimates the most fertile/ovulation days if a woman has a regular menstrual cycle. As it estimates fertile window on the basis of:
		<ul>
			<li>The first date of your last menstrual period</li>
			<li>Average Length of Cycles</li>
			<li>Luteal Phase (optional)</li>
		</ul>

	</div><hr/>
    
	<div class="">
		<h2 class="text-info"><strong> Ovulation and Conception: (Overview): </strong></h2>
		Ovulation is referred to as the release of eggs from the ovaries. In women, when the ovarian follicles rupture and release the secondary oocyte ovarian cells, this event takes place. Right after ovulation, the egg then moves down the fallopian tube where it can be fertilized. If sperm are in the fallopian tube when the egg is released, then there will be a good chance that the egg will be fertilized, creating an embryo, which can grow into baby.<br/><br/>

		And, during ovulation period, your body produces increased amount of hormone called estrogen which triggers further the release of another hormone called luteinising hormone. This luteinizing hormone is the cause of release of an egg from the ovary the release of the egg takes place 24 to 36 hours after the luteinizing hormone level reaches peak point. That is why fertility window is best predicted by luteinizing hormone level around the time of ovulation cycle and this process is called the luteal phase.<br/><br/>

		<div class="text-primary"><strong>Point To Be Consider:</strong> </div><br/>

		Note: Every month egg is released from one of the ovaries make its way to the uterus through the fallopian tube. It is the time when an egg can be fertilized by the sperm. But this egg can survive only for 12-24 hours while a sperm can live in the female body for three to six days. So, it means that ovulation occurs only one time during each menstrual cycle and typically lasts from 12 to 24 hours. Remember that having regular sexual intercourse 5 days before and on the day of ovulation can improve the chances of conception. Try an online ovulation calculator that helps those couples who intend to have contraception without using medical devices, pill or procedures.
		</div><hr/>

		<h2 class="text-primary"><strong>Signs of Ovulation:</strong></h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Rise in basal body temperature</li>
			<li>Cervical mucus, or vaginal discharge which may appear clearer, thinner, and stretchy, like the texture of egg whites</li>
			<li>Higher levels of luteinizing hormone (LH)</li>
			<li>Breast tenderness</li>
			<li>Bloating</li>
			<li>Light spotting</li>
			<li>Slight pain or cramping in your side</li>
			<li>Heightened sense of smell</li>
			<li>Changes in appetite or mood</li>
		</ul>
		These symptoms do not only help you to notice and estimate the exact time of your ovulation (fertile days), you can use an online ovulation calendar to know the best time of conceiving. Also, these symptoms can’t be noticed by every woman. However, some can notice and track their ovulation period. It is good and very helpful to know the fertility window as it can tells you when to try to conceive.<br/>
		Once you got pregnant, try this online pregnancy calculator that calculates your expected due date and shows the pregnancy week by week highlights.<hr/>

	<h2 id="When-Does-Ovulation-Occur" class="text-info"><strong>When Does Ovulation Occur?</strong></h2>
	<p>When it comes to an average 28-day menstrual cycle, typically ovulation occurs about 14 days before the start of the next menstrual period. But, in most women, ovulating takes place in the 4 days before or after the midpoint of the menstrual cycle.</p>
	<h2 id="Simple-Ways-to-predict-ovulation"><strong>Simple Ways to Predict Ovulation:</strong></h2>
	<p>How do you predict ovulation, don’t fret we are here to helps you with-in some legitimate ways that help you to predict ovulating. So, simply take your time to find the one that is right for you!</p>
	<h3><strong>Tracking Your Menstrual Cycles:</strong></h3>
	<p>The normal cycles can range from 21-35 days, while the average menstrual cycle is 28 days. When it comes to counting cycle days, you should consider cycle day 1 as the first day of full flow menses. Remember that ovulation “the release of an egg from the ovary” usually takes place 14 days prior to the next menstrual cycle or close to mid-cycle.</p>
	<p>You should stick to a menstrual calendar to figure out what is best time to conceive. Remember that if your menstrual cycles are irregular, then this method may not be accurate for you. However, our accurate ovulation calculator doesn’t calculate your most fertile days, if your cycle is irregular.</p>
	<h3><strong>Ovulation Calendar Method:</strong></h3>
	<p>Well, without considering personal and inter-cycle variation, ovulation takes place about 14 days before the onset of the next period. If you are going to use the calendar method of fertility, then you have to start charting the length of your menstrual cycle and calculate the predicted due date of ovulation from there.</p>
	<p>However, this is not always accurate, since every woman and every menstrual cycle is different. Usually, it takes more than 1 year of continuous charting to entirely understand the pattern of your cycle. Although, it is simpler to do so, but it may not be most best and accurate method when you decided to get pregnant or avoid pregnancy naturally. And, if you don’t want to charting manually, then use our free ovulation calendar calculator that shows you the calendar and highlight the fertile period and exact ovulation days.</p>
	<h3><strong>Basal Body Temperature:</strong></h3>
	<p>Basal body temperature (BBT) is referred to as a body temperature at rest. Typically, it is important to measure it in the morning, make sure before you get out of bed. Remember that BBT increases about .5°F about 12 hours after ovulation.</p>
	<p>Notice that the fertile window starts about 4 days before BBT surges. So, given this, by the time you can track the temperature surge, already it is too late to predict the entire fertile window. You can give a try to fertile window calculator that predict fertile window (fertile period or fertile days) and shows the important date for cycle.</p>
	<p>The common problem with this ovulation calculation method is that it is highly affected by environment and health status. As 5°F is a rather small change, environmental temperature change including weather fluctuations, illness, physical exercise, or also the presence of electrical blankets or air conditioning could highly affect your temperature and make BBT fluctuate more than 0.5°F.</p>
	<h3><strong>Hormone Testing For Ovulation Prediction:</strong></h3>
	<p>Remember that Luteinizing Hormone or (LH) surges about 24 hours before ovulation. Physiological studies depicted that LH hormone is the primary cause of ovulation. Even also estrogen increases about 4 days before LH surge. Both Estrogen and LH combined to provide women the full fertile window. Apart from the ultrasounds that only can be done in the Hospital, this is said to be the most accurate method doctors use to predict ovulating date.</p>
	<p>The daunting phase is that hormone levels significantly vary across different women and cycles. When it comes to Ovulation Prediction Kit (OPK), it determines ovulating day that is based on a set hormone threshold, which entirely leads to false-positive and false-negative outcomes.</p>
	<h3><strong>Tracking Cervical Mucus Changes to Predict Ovulation:</strong></h3>
	<p>You ought to note the changes in cervical mucus for tracking ovulation. Studies depicted that ovulating approaches your cervical mucus changes form thick to thin and even almost an egg-white consistency. An advanced ovulation calculator free tells you when does ovulating start and also the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/pregnancy/when-am-i-most-fertile-during-my-cycle/" rel="nofollow">most fertile days</a>. Remember that every woman’s cervical is unique, so you ought to consider your own pattern in order to accurately track changes over time.</p>
